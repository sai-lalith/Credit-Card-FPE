# Credit-Card-FPE
## Simple credit card system using pycryptodome, sockets, pickle 
# Abstract
Format Preserving Encryption (FPE) schemes encrypt a plaintext into a

ciphertext while preserving its format (e.g., a valid credit card number is en-
crypted into a valid credit card number), thus allowing encrypted data to be

stored and used in the same manner as unencrypted data. Motivated by the
always increasing use of cloud-computing and memory delegation, which require
preserving both plaintext format and privacy. we implemented a simple credit
card processing system using FF3-1 format preserving encryption scheme based
on recent 2019 NIST standards in python.

# Future work to be done

We hope to make the ff3-1 an opensource library with more flexibilty and a code optimization
